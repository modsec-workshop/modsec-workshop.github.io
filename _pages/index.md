title: First International Workshop on Modeling and Security
permalink: /
---

Integrating security in all the design and development steps of a software is an increasingly complex challenge. 
Choosing the right language, adopting a correct architecture, building a strong test suite, maintaining the software 
after deployment: these are some of the tasks that impacts the overall security of a software. In today's environment, 
security cannot be an afterthought and must be integrated from the get-go as it affects the complete life cycle 
of a software. One wrong doing can have catastrophic consequences from the leaks of personal data to the shutdown of 
an essential service that others are depending on.

Securely building and maintaining a software throughout its lifetime requires unified effort from many different domains. 
One decision early on can cascade and impact the later development stages. Yet, the research done in different fields 
feels disconnected as each of them has its own set of objectives and use cases.
We believe that both the software engineering and the security communities need a workshop to meet up and align past and
future research activities.
Methods and techniques in one domain could be leveraged or adapted in another one to better protect modern software and 
we feel a workshop is needed to engage the discussion and incite collaboration from researchers in fields that do not 
necessarily communicate with one another.

This first edition of the ModSec Workshop is an attempt to make the Software Engineering community and the Security 
community meet and discuss about their own views of models and security. It aims at defining the future directions of 
this important research area that will find new applications in the upcoming years by bringing together world experts
 in the fields for an intense one-day workshop.

# Call for papers and demos
We invite you to submit a paper and join us at the ModSec workshop, which will be held on October 18 2020 in Montreal, 
Canada.
We are excited to welcome original work describing research, visions, or demos in all areas at the intersection 
of software engineering and security for this workshop.
We are interested especially in contributions that look at modeling security either from the software engineering perspective, 
or the security point of view (with threats models, attackers and defenders models).

We accept both longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in 
progress or work that has yet to begin in a vision track. This decision to accept both types of submissions aims to 
include researchers at all stages of their career and at all stages of their projects.  

We also invite submissions to present a tool during the workshop in a special demo track that can demonstrate interest for 
workshop's participants.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- **Modeling Security:** Threat models and attackers, Secure system requirements and architecture, Software variability and diversity for security
- **Security in the Development Process:** Security testing methodologies, Patch and update management, Security in lifecycle development
- **Security in Machine Learning-based Systems:** Security methodologies for machine learning, adversarial machine learning, modeling security in machine learning, modeling machine learning
- **Secure Modeling:** Modeling with security aspects, V&V, Secure Software Variability

We have observed that the most effective workshops are those that encourage discussion between attendees. 
Each paper presentation will be followed by about 10 minutes of discussion to promote engagement and helpful feedback.

For accepted papers, at least one author must attend the workshop.



### Submission Instructions
Submissions must be uploaded through EasyChair at the following link 

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modsec2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=modsec2020)
 
We accept three types of publications:

- **Research track**: Full research papers (10 pages) present a novel, innovative approach to one of the workshop’s topics. 
References may be collected in 2 additional pages.
- **Vision track**: Short papers (5 pages) present new ideas or early-stage research related to one of the workshop’s topics. 
References may be collected in 1 additional page.
- **Demo track**: Demo papers (2 pages) introduces a tool that allows the modelling of security aspects or
 that can demonstrate an interest for workshop’s participants. We expect tool presentation to be 15 minutes or less
  during the workshop.

All submissions must be in PDF and in the ACM format. Formatting instructions are available at 
[https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) for both 
LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, 
enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), 
and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). 
The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

All accepted workshop papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library along with the main conference’s proceedings.

# Important dates
Paper submission deadline:  **July 24, 2020**

Notification of acceptance: August 14, 2020

Workshop dates: October 18-19, 2020

# Venue and Registration
ModSec is co-located with the IEEE 23rd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems
(MODELS) in Montreal, Canada. The workshop will take place before the main conference. Registration details will be 
handled by the main conference and will be posted closer to the event itself on their website.
